tips to working with git and github

**Joshua Limaye**

While I study Economics, I tend towards Data Analytics/Science. My minor in Statistics and Data Science paired with my B.A., I hope will, position me well for employment in industry.

In the last three months, I have spent most of my time betwween two research projects and my teaching assistant role in the College of Economics. 

To stay organized, I begin each week by writing all of my to-dos and assigining them to a day I'd like to do them.
